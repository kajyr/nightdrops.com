<h1>Hi! I am Carlo</h1>

<p>
I am an <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/carlopanzi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-show="manager">engineering manager</a>,
a <a href="https://github.com/kajyr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-show="developer">fullstack developer</a> and in my free time a <a href="/scuba" data-show="scuba">scuba diver</a>.
</p>

<p id="manager" class="hidden mt-6 more">
Since i was a kid I was always the kind of kid that creates groups of friends, creates a network of connections, plans adventures and makes things happen.
Since 2011 I am leading tech teams and engineering organizations,
ranging from a small frontend teams in a major ecommerce, to various cross functional teams building complex SaaS products.<br/>
See my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/carlopanzi" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">linkedIn page</a> for more details!

<p id="developer" class="hidden mt-6 more">
I started my career toying with linux servers and C++ at uni, and then - driven by curiosity and a sense of adventure -
I moved to work on web applications, videogames, and everything that interacts with the users and tells the story of a product. I started working in ActionScript 2,
then 3,  then moved to Javascript and the whole web ecosystem.
Over the years I had the chance to work with a variety of technologies and stacks, from LAMP to MEAN, from mobile apps to serverless, and my secret weapon is always creating a strong connection with the Product functions in each company, to understand deeply the users needs and deliver the best possible tools.<br/>
I have a <a href="https://github.com/kajyr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a> profile, where I work daily and hosts some little projects I love to share!

<p class="hidden mt-6 more" id="scuba">
I started scuba diving at 12 - the minimum legal age - and since then it has become one of my biggest passions. I love exploring the underwater world, its colors, its shapes, and the incredible biodiversity that lives there. In 2019 I got my instructor certificate and in 2023 I became an <span data-show="scuba-teaching" >instructor trainer</span>.
</p>
<p class="hidden mt-6 more" id="scuba-teaching">
The joy of teaching fits perfectly with my love for sharing knowledge and helping others grow, both in my professional and personal life. Training instructors and coaching them has a very clear parallel with my role as an engineering manager, where I focus on mentoring and developing team leaders and team members to reach their full potential.
